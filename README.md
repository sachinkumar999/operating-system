# project name 
A tool that will detect potential deadlock in the system process



# Basic Usage Guide


# 1. Understanding the Interface
When you run the tool, you'll see three tabs:

System Configuration: Where you set up processes and resources
Deadlock Analysis: Where you detect and visualize deadlocks
Help: Contains detailed instructions and explanation of concepts
# 2. Setting Up Your System
Adding Processes and Resources
In the "System Configuration" tab:
Enter a name (e.g., "P1") in the Process ID field and click "Add Process"
Enter a name (e.g., "R1") in the Resource ID field and click "Add Resource"
Add at least 2-3 processes and resources to model a realistic system
Creating Dependencies
In the Resource Allocation section:

Allocate: Assigns a resource to a process (the process now holds this resource)
Enter Process ID (e.g., "P1") and Resource ID (e.g., "R1")
Click "Allocate"
Request: Makes a process wait for a resource that's already allocated
Enter Process ID (e.g., "P2") and Resource ID (e.g., "R1")
Click "Request"
Release: Frees a resource that a process was holding
Enter Process ID and Resource ID
Click "Release"
# 3. Creating a Deadlock (Sample Scenario)
To create a simple deadlock:

Add processes P1 and P2
Add resources R1 and R2
Allocate R1 to P1
Allocate R2 to P2
Make P1 request R2 (P1 now holds R1 and is waiting for R2)
Make P2 request R1 (P2 now holds R2 and is waiting for R1)
This creates a circular wait condition where:

P1 holds R1 and needs R2
P2 holds R2 and needs R1
# 4. Detecting Deadlocks
Go to the "Deadlock Analysis" tab
Click "Detect Deadlocks"
The tool will:
Display a visual graph showing processes (blue circles) and resources (green squares)
Show allocations (solid green lines) and requests (dashed red lines)
List any detected deadlock cycles
Suggest resolution strategies
# 5. More Complex Scenarios
For a more complex system:

Add 3+ processes (P1, P2, P3, etc.)
Add 3+ resources (R1, R2, R3, etc.)
Create complex allocation patterns
For example:
P1 holds R1, requests R2
P2 holds R2, requests R3
P3 holds R3, requests R1
# 6. Saving/Loading Your Work
Use "Save Configuration" to save your system setup to a JSON file
Use "Load Configuration" to restore a previously saved setup
Use "Clear All" to start fresh
# 7. Understanding the Results
When deadlocks are detected, the tool will suggest resolution strategies:

Process Termination: Which process could be ended to break the deadlock
Resource Preemption: Which resource could be forcibly taken away
Resource Ordering: How to restructure resource requests to prevent deadlocks
The visualization shows the exact pattern of the deadlock, making it easy to understand the circular wait condition.
